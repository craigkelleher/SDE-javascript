/*
1. document.getElementById(id) returns the ONE element with that id

E.g document.getElementById("myDiv") will return the element with the id "myDiv". If there is no element with the id "myDiv",  document.getElementById("myDiv") will return null

2. element.innerHTML gets or sets the HTML contained within an element


E.g
const myBody = document.body.innerHTML; assigns the HTML content of the body element to myBody variable

document.getElementById("myH1").innerHTML = "Cool header"; makes the element with the id "myH1" contain "Cool header" as its content

BONUS:
- Can you find another way to select an element using it's id other than using the getElementById() method?

- Can you find better ways to get or set the text within an element instead of using innerHTML?
